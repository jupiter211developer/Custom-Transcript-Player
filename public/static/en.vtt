00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:05.940
Yup.

00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:07.433
I

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:07.553
said

00:00:07.553 --> 00:00:07.912
it

00:00:07.912 --> 00:00:08.72
before

00:00:08.72 --> 00:00:08.112
and

00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:08.391
I'll

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:08.471
say

00:00:08.471 --> 00:00:08.750
it

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.250
again.

00:00:10.146 --> 00:00:10.465
Life

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:10.705
moves

00:00:10.705 --> 00:00:11.143
pretty

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:11.502
fast.

00:00:12.221 --> 00:00:12.340
You

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:12.619
don't

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:12.819
stop

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:12.939
and

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:13.218
look

00:00:13.218 --> 00:00:13.457
around

00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:13.657
once

00:00:13.657 --> 00:00:13.736
in

00:00:13.736 --> 00:00:13.856
a

00:00:13.856 --> 00:00:14.56
while.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.899
You

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:15.99
could

00:00:15.99 --> 00:00:15.298
miss

00:00:15.298 --> 00:00:15.458
it.
